 Contributed stuff
===================

This directory contains miscellaneous contributed stuff for IFM:

``ifm.vim``
     Support for IFM syntax colouring in ``vim`` (a ``vi`` clone),
     contributed by `Dave Chapeskie`_.  This has been partially updated for
     version 5.x of IFM, but isn't yet complete.

``ifm-mode.el``
     GNU Emacs IFM mode.  Has syntax colouring and checking, commands to
     display maps, items and tasks, and a mode menu.

``pyifhilite``
     A Pygments extension to syntax-highlight IFM code and IF transcripts.

``rec2scr``
     Perl script which invokes the ``dumb-frotz`` interpreter (available
     from the IF archive) to non-interactively convert a recording of game
     commands into a transcript.  Very useful for testing the recording
     output from IFM.

``chess.pl``
     Perl script to write a chess board in IFM format.  One of the
     precursors to ``asciimapper``.
