<P>
IFM is a language for keeping track of your progress through an Interactive
Fiction game, and a program for producing various different sorts
of output using it. You can record each room you visit and its relation
to other rooms, the initial locations of useful items you find, and
the tasks you need to perform in order to solve the game.

<P>
The IFM mapping commands are designed so that you can easily add to
the map as you explore the game. You type in the rooms you visit and
the directions you move in to reach other rooms, and IFM calculates
the position of each room in relation to the others. A map can consist
of several independent sections, allowing you to divide up the map
however you like. See Section <A HREF="node5.htm#sec:making-maps">2</A> for an example
of how to make a map.

<P>
The IFM task commands, if used, allow you to specify the order in
which game-solving tasks must be done. The IFM program can then calculate
and print a high-level ``walkthrough'' of the game. See Section
<A HREF="node6.htm#sec:solving-game">3</A> for examples of how to do this.

<P>
Several output formats are available, including PostScript, Fig and
ASCII text--these are described in Section<A HREF="node7.htm#sec:using-ifm">4</A>. Some
of the output formats have a set of variables which control the appearance
of the output--see Section <A HREF="node7.htm#sec:output-variables">4.4</A>.

<P>
When I started playing IF games, years ago, I did what many other
people did--made a rough map on paper of where I'd explored, so I
could see which directions I hadn't tried yet. Inevitably, the maps
always fell off the page and turned into a complete mess.

<P>
My first attempt at solving this problem was to make use of the tools
I had available to draw the map for me. So I started typing the map
network into a file, and wrote a small Perl script to convert the
data into something that groff could read and draw a map from. I also
added a way of recording which items I'd found, and whether I'd found
a use for them yet.

<P>
As it stood, this worked quite well--it produced nice maps and lists
of items so I could see where I'd got to. The only problem was that
it was just as tedious making maps this way as on paper, since I had
to work out the offset of each room relative to a fixed origin.

<P>
Eventually I decided that enough was enough. I wanted to be able to
add stuff to the map as I played the game, without having to worry
about offsets or anything irrelevant like that. Hence the main design
criteria for IFM. The other criteria were easy--an input language,
for flexibility and extendability, and a program for converting files
in this language into different types of output.

<P>
Partway through writing the initial version of IFM, I had the idea
that it would be nice to be able to somehow record not only the map
and items found so far, but what's been done to solve the game. The
concept of tasks appeared, which immediately tripled the size of the
program and caused all sorts of headaches.

<P>
But eventually it got to the stage where it might be worth releasing,
so in June 1998 the first version appeared in the IF archive. Very
soon after that, I got a lot of feedback from one Dave Chapeskie (<TT>dchapes@ddm.wox.org</TT>),
who made a lot of great suggestions for improvements and new features.
He also very kindly started up a Web page for IFM maps; you can find
it at http://www.sentex.net/&nbsp;dchapes/ifm.

<P>
And now, finally, it's finished and I can go back to that IF game
I was playing.<A NAME="tex2html1"
