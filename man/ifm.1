IFM \- Interactive Fiction Mapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ifm
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfile\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
IFM is a program for keeping track of your progress through an Interactive
Fiction game.  You can record each room you visit and its relation to other
rooms, the initial locations of useful items you find, and the tasks you
need to perform in order to solve the game.

The IFM mapping commands are designed so that you can easily add to the map
as you explore the game.  You type in the rooms you visit and the
directions you move in to reach other rooms, and IFM calculates the
position of each room relative to the others.  A map can consist of several
independent sections, allowing you to divide up the map however you like.

The IFM task commands, if used, allow you to specify the order in which
game-solving tasks must be done.  The IFM program can then calculate and
print different styles of walkthrough for the game.

IFM can write hardcopy maps directly to PostScript, suitable for printing
or viewing.  It can also write maps in Fig format, which can be viewed and
edited using Xfig, or converted into many other formats.

This man page just presents a summary of the command-line options.  Online
documentation on how to use IFM can be found in the
