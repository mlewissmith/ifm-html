Mapping programs and tools
==========================

* GUEmap_ is the most popular graphical mapping tool used on Windows.

* IFMapper_ is a graphical mapping tool for Linux and Windows and has the
  ability to read and write IFM and GUEmap_ maps.  It also uses (and
  improves on) the :doc:`scr2ifm <scr2ifm>` algorithm for mapping
  transcripts.

* Frobot_ creates maps in a similar manner to :doc:`scr2ifm <scr2ifm>`, by
  analyzing a game transcript.

* ifm2i7_ is a Perl script which converts IFM maps into `Inform 7`_ input,
  using IFM's :ref:`raw <raw>` output format.

* asciimapper_ is a Perl script which takes ASCII representations of maps
  and converts them to IFM format.

Existing IFM maps
=================

* There's a web page set up by Dave Chapeskie (dchapes@ddm.wox.org) which
  has many IFM maps in source and PostScript format, at

      http://www.sentex.ca/~dchapes/ifm

  At the moment it contains maps of a few Infocom and Inform games.  Some
  are complete, others not quite.  A few have tasks set up so that a
  walkthrough can be made.  The site hasn't been updated for a while.

* Another site containing some IFM maps can be found at:

* The game-solving side of IFM touches on an area of research at McGill
  University called `Narrative Flow Graphs`_.
